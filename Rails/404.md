#404

Today, I was working on a bug in our product show page. The page was blowing up because we had inserted a raise 'foo' statement when a product.variant was not found. This was great during the initial development, but now we needed to simply return a 404 error. It turns out ActiveRecord provides us with this functionality. All I had to do was replace raise 'foo' with raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound.new.

```def variant_for_network( network )
    variant = Variant.find_by(name: network')
    raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound.new unless variant
    variant
  end```
