> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by pairing with
smart people at [SpendWell Health](https://www.spendwellhealth.com/).

[thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
